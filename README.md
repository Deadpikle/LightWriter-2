# LightWriter 2
LightWriter 2 is an online web application that can be used to teach very basic programming concepts, 
such as loops and conditionals. LightWriter 2's goal is to rewrite LightWriter (1) in TypeScript and PHP and thus
improve maintainability, code readability, and other nice things.

The website is pretty fun. Give it a try!
 
### TODO 

Once the port is complete, we can start expanding the initial scope of the project.

- Offline save and load
- Default algorithms that are available for everyone to load
- Other magical unicorns and rainbows
 
### Previous Versions of LightWriter
View the first version of LightWriter [here](https://github.com/Deadpikle/LightWriter). The previous version was written 
for a senior project computer science class and was thus built a little more hastily than it could have been.
