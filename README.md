# LightWriter 2

LightWriter 2 is an online web application that can be used to teach very basic programming concepts, 
such as algorithms, loops, and conditionals. LightWriter 2's goal is to rewrite and refactor 
[the original LightWriter](https://github.com/Deadpikle/LightWriter) to
improve maintainability, code readability, and other nice things.

The website is also pretty fun to just mess around with. Give it a try!

### Building and Running

Run the project using your favorite LAMP stack!
1. Setup your favorite LAMP stack
2. Add a MySQL or MariaDB database and database user for LightWriter
3. Copy database.sample.php to database.php
4. Add the details for the database connection to database.php
5. Run the SQL script found in doc/lightwriter.sql
6. Have fun!

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Everything needs to be done. Things need to be rewritten. Newer and better technologies can be used. Give it a go and get a pull request up!

Don't know what to work on? Check out the TODO.md file in this directory! Or just find some poorly thought out code and refactor/rewrite it!
 
### Previous Versions of LightWriter

View the first version of LightWriter [here](https://github.com/Deadpikle/LightWriter). The previous version was written 
for a senior project computer science class. It was built in haste (it was a one semester project/prototype, after all),
and the web itself was a **lot** different in late 2013, so lots of things have changed in the web development world since then!

Regardless of how some things might be clunky in the current version, we want to fix all that and improve LightWriter so that
it can be extended and improved. Want to give it a go? Hop in the code and have fun!
