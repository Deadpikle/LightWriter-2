# TODO

## General

* Minify JS code

## Blocks

* Better block prototype/class
* Don't hardcode block types/template names in multiple places
* Improve `this.ABCD` locations so properties are easy to see

## API/Ajax calls

* Make all calls more secure-ish by using user token rather than user ID
* Sharing algorithm shouldn't just blindly load the pattern ID
